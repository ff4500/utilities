# Basic Mac utilities setup

Goes along with the post over [here](https://jasonpitman.com/journal/making-thumbs/), but is also used to check/setup the following on a Mac:

- Checks for existing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) install. Installs it via `ruby` otherwise. Will also update an existing Homebrew install.
- Checks for existing [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) install. Installs it via `brew` otherwise.
- Checks for existing [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) install. Installs it via `cask` otherwise.
- Checks for existing [Atom](https://atom.io/) install. Installs it via `cask` otherwise.
- Checks for existing [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) install. Installs it via `brew` otherwise.

It's kind of a mess right now, but it works. Will be spending some time on it making it a little prettier soon.
